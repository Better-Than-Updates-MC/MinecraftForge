*** HOW TO INSTALL ***

The forge directory should have been uncompacted right under your MCP root 
directory.

You should a a fresh minecraft and minecraft_server.jar freshly decompiled 
with ModLoader and ModLoaderMP.

Just run the script install.bat. It will copy the Minecraft Forge source on your
src directory, and modify the Minecraft source files.
